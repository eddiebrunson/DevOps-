### 1. Ansible Intro

#### Ansible - Introduction
Ansible is an IT automation tool that can automate the system configuration, software deployment, and infrastructure orchestration for continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. It is an open-source community project sponsored by Red Hat -

Ansible uses YAML to write Ansible Playbooks. Playbook files describe the automation tasks. The following are the benefits of using this automation tool:

* Well-Suited Architecture - Ansible connects to the nodes (processing entities) and launches tiny programs, called Ansible modules. Modules are removed when they finish executing.

* Secure - Ansible uses SSH keys with ssh-agent. It supports Kerberos and other identity management systems.

* Simple, Scalable, and Manageable - Ansible uses INI file that contains the grouped information of all the nodes and machines that it is managing. This file makes it easy to deal with large scale infrastructure. A plain text inventory file looks like the following: ` [webservers] www1.example.com www2.example.com

[dbservers] db0.example.com db1.example.com
`
Easy orchestration - Ansible uses Playbooks, written in YAML, to describe the automation tasks with fine details. An example Playbook is:`

* hosts: webservers serial: 5 # update 5 machines at a time roles:
* common
* webapp `
* Extendable - We can write Ansible modules in any language that returns JSON (Ruby, Python, bash, etc). It supports a wide variety of plugins as well.

#### Ansible Overview
* Ansible is a configuration management language
* Leverages YAML (yet another modeling language) and JSON (Javascript object notation)
* Agent-less language which uses SSH (secure shell) to connect to servers
* Light-weight, but managing large clusters is slow
* Written in Python, Ruby and Powershell


### Configuration Management Desired State
Idempotency: “The property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.” Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence]
