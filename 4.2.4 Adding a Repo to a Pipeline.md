# 4. Build CI/CD Pipelines, Monitoring & Logging 

## Lesson 2: Jenkins Pipeline and Deployment Strategies 


### 4. Adding a Repo to a Pipeline
___

### Prerequisite - A Github repo

* Create a Github account.
   * "Sign in" to Github, if you already have a Github account.
   * Else, go to https://github.com and “Sign up” button in the upper right-hand corner.
* Create a new Github repository in your account.
* Download and install GitHub Desktop utility to work seamlessly.
* Open up your terminal/GitHub Desktop console and change to the directory of your choice (say Documents).
* Run the following command to clone the Course’s Github repo - git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-Build-CI-CD-Pipelines-Monitoring-and-Logging-v1. This command will create a clone, locally in your machine.
* Run cd <name of the downloaded repo> to enter into the downloaded repo. Notice that the origin repo has three branches - master, blue, and green. Stay on the master branch.
* Change the origin - By default, origin would point to the Course’s Github repo. Change the origin using
```
git remote -v 
git remote remove origin 
git remote add origin <link to Github repository in **your account**>
```
* Edit the file `Jenkinsfile` using any editor, such as VI, Visual Studio Code, or any other.
* Commit the file `Jenkinsfile` in the master branch into your own local repository, using the command
```
git add . --all
git commit -m “my comment“
``` 
* Push your local changes to your Github account, using `git push origin`, that will push changes from all local branches to matching branches the origin remote.
