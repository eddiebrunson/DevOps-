What is AWS Lambda?
From the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html):

"AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers."

* "AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
* You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running."

"You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events," such as HTTP requests.

### SQS Queue
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.

* A **queue** is just a type of list that orders data in a particular way; typically in a first-item-in = first-item-out order (FIFO), as shown below.

Learn more about SQS in the [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).

### MXNet and Lambda
