### Deployment Strategies
Deployment strategy is an approach to roll out the updates/changes made in the "live" application. The idea is that the application must not be brought down to introduce the updates. There are a variety of strategies available. Let's assume that there are two versions of the software applications - version A and B. Version B is the updated version.

* **Rolling** - Version B is gradually rolled out succeeding version A. This is suitable when the updates are very small, such as bug fixes.
* **Blue/Green** - Version B is released alongside version A, then the traffic is switched to version B. This is the preferred model when there are major updates or releasing new features.
* **Canary** - Version B is released to a specific subset of users for early feedback and testing, then proceed to a complete rollout.
* **A/B testing** - Version B is released to a subset of users under particular conditions.
* **Recreate** - Version A is terminated first, and then the version B is rolled out.
* **Shadow** - Version B receives real-world traffic alongside version A and doesnâ€™t impact the response.
We will follow Blue-Green deployment strategy in this concept.

### Blue Green Deployment Explained
Blue green deployment enables deploying new code to environments while keeping the existing environment up until the new environment is ready. This is important for providing a consistently working environment to the end users of the code/website. In addition, it allows us to independently test the new environment before putting it in front of the end user. To accomplish blue green deployment it requires setting up this identical environment, switching the load balancer, and verifying that the code base has changed through the website.

In order to follow Blue-Green deployment strategy, we need to have the following tools/plugins available in our Jenkins host - Ansible, Boto - a Python interface to AWS, and CloudBees AWS plugin. Ansible is a tool for automated provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment in target infrastructure using code. In the overarching diagram, we saw the role of Ansible in the deployment. Let's install the tools/plugins mentioned above, to get started with Blue-Green deployment. We will learn more about Ansible in the next lesson.

### Blue/Green Deployment Strategy
* `apt install ansible`
* `pip install boto`
* Jenkins plugin CloudBees AWS Credentials Plugin
* Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins
* Map credentials from Jenkins to Pipeline application

### Blue/Green Deployment IAM Policy
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "route53:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes",
                "elasticloadbalancing:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
