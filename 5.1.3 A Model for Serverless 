### Models for Serverless
Though we'll be using AWS cloud tools, there are a number of other providers that you can use to build serverless applications with auto-scaling capabilities. The skills you learn in this lesson will be widely applicable to these other platforms. Some of the larger, cloud providers include:

* Amazon Web Services [ [Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice) & [Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)]
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/?pli=1)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

And you are welcome to check these out, especially if you have a platform that you already prefer.
