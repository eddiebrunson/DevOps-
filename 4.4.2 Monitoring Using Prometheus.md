## Lesson 4: Monitoring 


### 1. Monitoring using Prometheus
___

Prometheus
“In Greek mythology, Prometheus (/prəˈmiːθiːəs/; Greek: Προμηθεύς, pronounced [promɛːtʰéu̯s], possibly meaning "forethought")[1] is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who is credited with the creation of man from clay, and who defies the gods by stealing fire and giving it to humanity….” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus

In the world of Cloud DevOps, Prometheus is a very useful, flexible tool for our monitoring.

### Install and Configure Node Exporter
Next we want to install a node exporter as a new user, and configure it to send data into Promotheus. A detailed tutorial to install a node_exporter is available [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/).

> Note - You can directly download the node_exporter package from https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter as well.
