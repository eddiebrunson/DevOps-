### Steps to Create a Pipeline in Blue Ocean
As we have installed AWS and Blue Ocean plugins into Jenkins on our Ubuntu EC2 instance, next, we will follow the steps below to create a Pipeline in Blue Ocean.

1.Fork/Clone the course's Github repository. We will add one Github repository per project. A single Github repository can be re-used in multiple Pipelines.
2. Create your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean.
3. Create your initial Pipeline
4. Use Jenkins to add multiple stages (environments) using Jenkinsfile. Generally, a Pipeline should have three stages (environments) defined in a Jenkinsfile: Development (build), Staging (test), and Deployment. See a declarative Pipeline example [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/#pipeline-example).
5. Create multiple pipelines, each for Development (build), Staging (test), and Deployment, by creating branches in your Git repository.


### Recommended Read
We recommend you to read the handbook [documentation for setting up a Pipeline using Blue Ocean](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/creating-pipelines/) before proceeding to the next set of steps.
