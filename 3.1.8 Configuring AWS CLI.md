## Lesson 1: Getting Started with CloudFormation 


### 8. Configure AWS CLI

___

### Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Download and install the [AWS CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
* In the terminal, type `aws --version`: this verifies that you have the AWS CLI tool.
* To set up your AWS CLI, type `aws configure `in the terminal. Next when prompted for the AWS Access Key ID, paste in your `Secret access key`.
* Region: Please use us-west-2, even if you’re living closer to another available region.

### Verifying your Setup
* One way to check if your AWS CLI is set up properly is to try a command. You can try listing your S3 buckets:`aws s3 ls` . This will be blank if you have no S3 buckets. However, if you have no error message, then you’ve verified that your user has API access to communicate with AWS.
* Note that each user can have up to 2 access keys at the same time.
