### 9. Virtual Private Cloud

___

### Glossary

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: A virtual private cloud is a pool of networked cloud resources. It can span more than one availability zone.
The equivalent of this would be a data center. However, thanks to availability zones, VPCs can span more than one physical building. This is an amazing feature that protects against real world disasters like electrical failures, fires and similar events.

* Main attribute of VPC is to block available IP addresses aka address space and the CIDR block
* Each numner is called an `octet` because each number has eight bits in binary. 0-255
* 10.0.0/16 means reserve the top 16 bits, two octets or the first two numbers to be the fixed part of this netowrk.
* 0.0 = 256 * 256 = about 65,000 IP addresses available within your private cloud

### Subnets

* Create separation between resources 
* Block or Allow access to/form groups of resources 
* Provide services to a specific set of resources
