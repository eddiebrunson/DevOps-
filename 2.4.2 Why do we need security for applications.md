# 2. Cloud Foundamentals 

## Lesson 4: Security


### 2. Why do we need security for applicaitons?


As adoption of cloud services has increased, so has the need for increased security in the cloud. The great thing about cloud security is that it not only protects data, it also protects applications that access the data. Cloud security even protects the infrastructure (like servers) that applications run on.

The way security is delivered depends on the cloud provider you're using and the cloud security options they offer.
