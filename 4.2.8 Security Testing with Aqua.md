### 8. Security Testing with Aqua 
___


### Security Testing with Aqua
Aqua is a Jenkins plugin designed for testing Docker containers. It is one of many security vulnerability scanners available, testing against CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Weâ€™ll install and show how to use Aqua next.

### Aqua Testing Summary
* Aqua is used for scanning Docker containers for CVE
* Aqua depends on Docker
* Aqua can be integrated into a testing pipeline in the Continuous Integration stage


### Pipeline Testing - Key ideas
* **Linting** - It is the process of running a program that checks the Pipeline code for potential syntax errors.

* **Security Testing** - It is performed with a variety of software to test for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). There are a variety of [security testing plugins available for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ui/search?sort=relevance&categories=buildManagement&labels=&view=Tiles&page=1&query=security%20testing). In the next concept, we will demonstrate to use Aqua MicroScanner, which enables scanning of Docker builds for OS package vulnerabilities.

* **Performance Testing** - It is done by setting up a smaller scale environment as compared to production, with Jenkins and running simulated host calls into that environment to determine how the new environment performs under a particular workload. It is a two-stage process -

   * Stage 1 - Run Apache JMeter - JMeter is a testing tool used for estimating the performance of the newly created Jenkins environment. Here is a [Tutorial to run JMeter with ](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/How+to+run+JMeter+with+Jenkins)
   * Stage 2 - Capture Reports - Jenkins provides Performance plugin to capture reports from popular testing tools, such as JMeter, Selenium, and many others in the XML and CSV format. We recommend you to follow along with the documentation available at the link mentioned-above about running tests and building reports with [Performance plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/performance/).
* **Integration Testing**  - It is testing the Pipeline code from different modules to make sure it all works together. It occurs after unit testing. Jenkins provides [JUnit plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/) as unit-testing framework to write repeatable tests. Refer [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/junit/) for reading the functionality of JUnit plugin using steps.
