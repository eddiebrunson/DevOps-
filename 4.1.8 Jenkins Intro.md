## Lesson 1: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment 


### 8. Jenkins Intro

### What is Jenkins?

To "expedite" the software development process, CI/CD has become an essential practice for rapid building, testing, and deployment. Jenkins is an automation server that is used to automate the tasks associated with CI/CD, such as building, testing, and deploying the application. There are many more other frameworks available in the market, as listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software).

Jenkins comes originally from the Hudson project, which had very similar features and functionality but was controlled by Sun Microsystems. Jenkins is an open-source tool that was released in 2011. Jenkins is written in Java language. The prime feature of Jenkins is Jenkins Pipeline.

### What is Jenkins Pipeline?
In general, a Pipeline is a set of tools and processes to automate the CI/CD of a software application. Jenkins Pipeline is a set of plugins that assist in achieving continuous delivery. Jenkins is highly modular and supports a multitude of plugins. Plugins extend Jenkins with additional features to support various requirements. We will cover a few of the plugins at a higher level in the next lesson.

`Jenkinsfile`
`Jenkinsfile` is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. This text file is stored into the application’s Source Control Repository e.g., Github. Storing the `Jenkinsfile` into a source control repository makes it possible to review and audit collaboratively. A Jenkinsfile can be written using two types of syntax - Declarative and Scripted. In this course, we will use the Declarative way to write `Jenkinsfile` .

### Recommended Read
* Jenkins provides Guided Tours, Tutorials, and Handbook documentation.
* Read the [handbook documentation for Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/). The snapshot below highlights the topics that would provide insight into the Pipeline.
* We suggest to read the Handbook first, and then go through the last two tutorials - “Create a Pipeline in Blue Ocean” and “End-to-End Multibranch Pipeline Project Creation”, later in this course.


AWS Pipeline Service [OPTIONAL TO READ]
AWS offers a CI/CD pipeline service, named as “CodePipeline”. This service can be used to model, visualize, as well as automate the steps required to release software. AWS CodePipeline enables us to increase the speed and quality of our development. It also runs a set of quality checks to ensure consistency. As a part of our project, we will need to provision (spinning-up) VMs in the cloud and use the service(s) of AWS.

AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy are the two most relevant services that are useful as a part of DevOps. AWS offers a plethora of other services, and you can see an implementation guide to set up a CI/CD pipeline on AWS [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/set-up-ci-cd-pipeline/?trk=gs_card).
