## Lesson 1: Getting Started with CloudFormation 


### 10. CloudFormation

___


### CloudFormation
* CloudFormation is a declarative language, not an imperative language.
* CloudFormation handles resource dependencies so that you don’t have to specify which resource to start up before another. There are cases where you can specify that a resource depends on another resource, but ideally, you’ll let CloudFormation take care of dependencies.
* VPC is the smallest unit of resource.


### Glossary
**Declarative languages**: These languages specify what you want, without requiring you to specify how to get it. An example of a popular declarative language is SQL.
**Imperative languages**: These languages use statements to change the state of the program.
